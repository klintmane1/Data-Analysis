# Data-Analysis
Projects in this repository are used to do data analysis using real data on stocks from the Great Recession as well as 911 calls in the US.
These projects help with data manipulation, engeneering and visualization. 
After I clean the data, I use packages such as seanorb and matplotlib to bisualize the data and better understand it. 
Finally I try to derive data analysis conclusions based on the visualizations.
The data is not uploaded due to size limits. 
Thanks!
